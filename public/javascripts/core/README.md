Issues to discuss:

(1) Attachment point for pull-through interchangers - their height depends on the cell that is being pulled through
    (a) Giving coordinates of the pulled-through cell is inconsistent with the current convention
    (b) Giving coordinates of the bottom left cell does not allow us to calculate the heights for RI and LI
    (c) For now a hack is implemented: modifying the attachment point inside intercharger target computation
